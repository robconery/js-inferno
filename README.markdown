## Code for Javascript Inferno Talk

I've given this talk a few times and have tweaked it here and there to the point where I think it's a neat resource for people to compare/contrast various JS frameworks.

This isn't supposed to be a tutorial. This is simply code that should give you a `feel` for each of these frameworks:

 * KnockoutJS
 * Backbone
 * Angular
 * Ember

## Three Tasks

I've centered the code around 3 tasks:

 * Setup and Showing Simple Data on Screen
 * Working with a List
 * Saving Data to the Server

Each framework has unique strenghts and weaknesses, so how these tasks are carried out will vary (for instance Ember uses Routing/URLs heavily, so I added that in this effort).

## Requirements

The server part uses NodeJS so you'll need that installed. Redis is used for data storage so you'll need that as well.

I've included the modules in the source (even though that's typically frowned upon) because I want you to be able to drop and run this code.
